# Resources

A list of resources that are helpful when developing UCLA Radio apps.

## VS Code

We love VS Code at UCLA Radio! It's fast and packed full of features. Any text
editor, though, has a bit of a learning curve so here are some resources that
will help you fall in love with VS Code even faster.

* [Visual Studio Code Can Do That?](http://vscodecandothat.com): A great site of
  some non-obvious features of VS Code.
* [LevelUpTuts: VS Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q1tD39Mk_A&list=PLLnpHn493BHHkdpK8E37x_d5cOZBr4GlL)

We also recommend the following plugins:

Here are some specific language settings and extensions we like:

* [VS Code Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons)
* [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [GitLens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)
* [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode):
  Automatic formatting with VS Code.
* [Color Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=naumovs.color-highlight):
  Highlighting for colors in your code!
* [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense):
  Autocompletion of filenames.

### HTML

VS Code has great support for writing HTML!

* [IntelliSense for CSS class names](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion#overview)
* [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)

### JavaScript

VS Code has a
[whole section of documentation of Node.js](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-tutorial)!
Be sure to check it out. They also cover
[debugging in Node](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

There's also great front JavaScript support in VS Code. Check out the
[documentation about React and VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/reactjs-tutorial)
and
[this blog post about debugging React in VS Code](https://medium.com/@auchenberg/live-edit-and-debug-your-react-apps-directly-from-vs-code-without-leaving-the-editor-3da489ed905f).

A reference of popular VS Code debugging recipes is
[here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/debugging-recipes).

* [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint):
  Integrating linting in VS Code.
* [Version Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pflannery.vscode-versionlens)

### TypeScript

* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)

## Developer Tools

## Git

Some handy resources to get you up to speed with Git and ready for your first
pull request.

* [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

## Terminal

We're big fans of terminal customization. If you aren't familiar or particularly
attached a certain shell, we recommend you check out
[Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/)! It has very nice autocompletion and
highlighting.

Your shell can be customized with what are called **dotfiles**â€”files usually
prepended with a `.` (meaning that they're hidden files). People put things in
their dotfiles and share them with other people, so much of your dotfiles will
be taken from other places on the internet. Read
[this great article](https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/)
by Zach Holman for more info about dotfiles.
