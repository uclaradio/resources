# Resources

A list of resources that are helpful when developing UCLA Radio apps.

## VS Code

We love VS Code at UCLA Radio! It's fast and packed full of features. Any text
editor, though, has a bit of a learning curve so here are some resources that
will help you fall in love with VS Code even faster.

* [Visual Studio Code Can Do That?](http://vscodecandothat.com): A great site of
  some non-obvious features of VS Code.

We also recommend the following plugins:

Here are some specific language settings and extensions we like:

* [VS Code Icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons)

[debugging in Node](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/nodejs-debugging).

You can also do frontend JavaScript debugging in VS Code. Check out
